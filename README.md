This repository contains all the python projects I've worked on or practiced concepts on. Additionally, I've also included excercises from:

1. Learn Python The Hard Way (LPTHW)
2. CodeAcademy

# Learn Python The Hard Way
Using the 1st Edition of Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, I learned and grew my Python 3 skills. Apparently this is a new edition and not the 4th edition because it teaches Python 3. The free HTML version of the book is available at [http://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) and it has been very helpful in my journey.

# CodeAcademy

To solidify my grasp of Python 3, I also took the [CodeAcademy Python 3 course] (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). I've included some of my exercises within this repository.
